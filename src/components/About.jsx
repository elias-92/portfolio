						About me
					</h2>
				</div>
				<p>
					My main virtue is effort. During the last year and a half, I have
					immersed myself in the world of front-end development with tireless
					dedication. I have invested a great number of hours in exploring
					various courses and personal projects with the goal of acquiring my
					first work experience in this fascinating profession. This constant
					dedication and my passion for learning has allowed me to acquire a
					broad set of skills and knowledge in the field of web development.
				</p>
				<p>
					I feel comfortable working in healthy work environments, where
					collaboration and mutual respect are fundamental. I strongly believe
					in bringing my best energies and empathy to the workspace every day.
					Valuing the importance of effective communication, I strive to
					maintain an open and receptive attitude towards other team members. I
					believe in building strong and positive relationships, as I believe
					that a healthy work environment fosters creativity and growth both
					individually and collectively.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, my motivation does not stop at achieving a job title. I am
					driven by a constant desire to continue learning and improving in my
					professional performance. I am excited to stay abreast of the latest
					trends and technologies in the front-end development arena, and I am
					committed to continuing to acquire new skills and knowledge.
					Continuous learning is essential to stay relevant and competitive in
					the ever-evolving technology field. In summary, my passion, effort and
					focus on continuous learning have led me to develop solid skills in
					front-end development. I am committed to contributing meaningfully in
					a positive and collaborative work environment, while continuing to
					seek opportunities to grow and advance my career.
